# URL Shortener
##### Project from [gophercises](https://gophercises.com) ([url shortener repo](https://github.com/gophercises/urlshort))

The goal of this exercise is to create a http.Handler that will look at the path of any incoming web request and determine if it should redirect the user to a new page, much like URL shortener would.
